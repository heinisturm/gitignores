# this is a hack to ignore binaries created by the compiler
# which usuly have no extension at all
# so we ignore all files first
# and then we unignore all files with an extension and all directories

# Ignore all
*

# Unignore all with extensions
!*.*

# Unignore all dirs
!*/

### Above combination will ignore all files without extension ###
